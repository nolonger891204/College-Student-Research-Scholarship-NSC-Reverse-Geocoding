## Reverse Geocoding with Semantic and Spatial Scale: A Case Study on Cell Broadcast.
This research analysed the geospatial semantics of geometry from the Reverse Geocoding point of view, in other words, it analysed the obtained vector geometry, included points, lines, and polygons, and combine with surrounding surface features and spatial relations. This process generates descriptive spatial properties in natural language. It can expend the information richness of geometry and provide innovate thought for applications. This research adopted the Public Warning Cell Broadcast Service  as the experimental subject for demonstration purposes. More specifically, this research operated the existing warning area of this service, transformed its geometry into a correspond spatial description, combined the result with the structure of existing broadcast messages, provided an automated process to generate what the message needs.
